If you’ve ever watched a developer’s face contort in rage during a tabs-vs-spaces debate, you know how **religious** these formatting discussions can get. But today, I’m here to talk about something even more contentious: **indent width**. Specifically, why I’ve abandoned the 2-space and 4-space camps for the _controversial_ yet _perfectly balanced_ **indent width of 3**.

Let’s dive into the chaos.

## The Great Indent Debate: A Quick Recap

Most programmers fall into one of two factions:

1. **The 2-Space Army**:  
   _"Less scrolling! Compact code! Modern IDEs handle nesting anyway!"_  
   Favored by JavaScript/TypeScript developers and fans of vertical density.

2. **The 4-Space Traditionalists**:  
   _"Readability! Structure! My linter said so!"_  
   Often seen in Python circles and legacy codebases.

But what if both sides are missing the point?

## Why 3 Spaces? The Case for the Middle Ground

### 1. **Readability Without the Bulk**

A 2-space indent can feel cramped, especially in deeply nested code. For example:

```javascript
// 2-space indent
// [!code highlight:3]
function calculateScore() {
   if (user.isActive) {
      let score = user.points * 10;
      if (score > 100) {
         return "Gold"; // [!code --]
         return "Plat"; // [!code ++]
      } else {
         return "Silver";
      }
   }
}
```

With 2 spaces, the hierarchy blurs. **4 spaces fix this**, but they eat horizontal real estate:

```javascript
// 4-space indent (prepare to scroll right...)
function calculateScore() {
   if (user.isActive) {
      let score = user.points * 10;
      if (score > 100) {
         return "Gold";
      } else {
         return "Silver";
      }
   }
}
```

**3 spaces strike a balance**: enough to visually separate blocks without pushing code off-screen.

```javascript
// 3-space indent (just right?)
function calculateScore() {
   if (user.isActive) {
      let score = user.points * 10;
      if (score > 100) {
         return "Gold";
      } else {
         return "Silver";
      }
   }
}
```

### 2. **It’s a Compromise Everyone Can Hate (But Secretly Love)**

Teams often waste hours debating 2 vs. 4. Proposing **3** short-circuits the argument:

- 2-space advocates get something "close enough" to their preference.
- 4-space loyalists get clearer nesting than 2.
- Everyone bonds over how absurd the suggestion is… until they try it.

### 3. **It Discourages Over-Nesting**

A 3-space indent subtly nudges developers to avoid deep nesting. If your code needs 6 levels of indentation, maybe it’s time to refactor instead of blaming the indent width. _Looking at you, callback hell._

### 4. **You’ll Stand Out (In a Good Way)**

Let’s face it: **3-space code looks distinct**. In a sea of 2s and 4s, your codebase becomes memorable. Recruiters might even ask about it in interviews. (“Wait, you use **3 spaces**? Tell me more about your pain tolerance.”)

## Addressing the Controversy

### “But… It’s Not a Power of Two!”

Neither are the number of keyboard keys you’ve broken out of frustration. **3 is a prime number**, and primes are the building blocks of mathematics. Coincidence? Absolutely. But it sounds profound.

### “My Linter Doesn’t Support 3!”

Most modern tools ([Prettier](https://prettier.io), [ESLint](https://eslint.org), etc.) let you customize indent width. If yours doesn’t, maybe it’s time to question your tools—not your dreams.

## How to Make the Switch

1. **Update your configs**:

   ```jsonc
   //! .prettierrc
   {
      "tabWidth": 2, // [!code --]
      "tabWidth": 3 // [!code ++]
   }
   ```

2. **Gaslight your team**:  
   Casually mention studies (that don’t exist) about 3-space indents improving code review speed.

3. **Embrace the backlash**:  
   Redirect anger away from meaningful debates like “Should we fix this legacy system?” to something trivial. _It’s a diversion tactic._

## Conclusion: Dare to be Different

Indentation is a tool, not a dogma. By choosing **3 spaces**, you’re not just picking a number—you’re embracing pragmatism over tradition. It’s the Goldilocks of indent widths: not too little, not too much, but _just right_.

Will the world burn? Maybe. But at least your code will look **spicy** while it does. 🔥
